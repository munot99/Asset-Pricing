# Asset-Pricing
The repository contains codes for datasets that deal with introduction to the foundations of Asset Pricing. It starts with the analysis of financial decision making under uncertainty. It then deals with equilibrium theories of the pricing of risky financial instruments as well as an overview of empirical tests of the theory and new theories that have emerged as a response to the failure of equilibrium asset pricing models.
NOTE :The codes have taken assistance from the TA as well as colleagues
